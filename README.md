**Abstract:**   
Unitary potential (UP) depolarizations are the basic intracellular events
responsible for pacemaker activity in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs), and
are generated at intracellular sites termed "pacemaker units". In this study,
we present a mathematical model of the transmembrane ion flows and
intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics from a single ICC pacemaker unit acting at near-
resting membrane potential. This model quantitatively formalizes the framework
of a novel ICC pacemaking mechanism that has recently been proposed. Model
simulations produce spontaneously rhythmic UP depolarizations with an
amplitude of approximately 3 mV at a frequency of 0.05 Hz. The model predicts
that the main inward currents, carried by a Ca(2+)-inhibited nonselective
cation conductance, are activated by depletion of sub-plasma-membrane [Ca(2+)]
caused by sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase Ca(2+) sequestration.
Furthermore, pacemaker activity predicted by our model persists under
simulated voltage clamp and is independent of [IP(3)] oscillations. The model
presented here provides a basis to quantitatively analyze UP depolarizations
and the biophysical mechanisms underlying their production.
